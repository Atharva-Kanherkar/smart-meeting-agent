    Based on the calendar data and attendee information:
    1. Research recent technical developments related to the meeting topic
    2. Look for relevant documentation, code repositories, or technical discussions
    3. Identify key technical concepts or technologies that might be discussed
    4. Gather information about current project status, recent changes, or technical challenges
    5. Use web search tools to find recent news, blog posts, or technical articles related to the topic
    
    Focus on providing technical background that would be useful for meeting preparation.
    Present the information in a structured format with key technical insights.

   - Dependency management between workflow steps
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **System Architecture:**
   - Microservices-based design
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Container orchestration (Kubernetes)

3. **Recent Developments:**
   - Implementation of new scheduling algorithms
   - Enhanced monitoring and observability features
   - Performance optimizations for large-scale workflows

**Technical Challenges:**
- Handling complex workflow dependencies
- Ensuring fault tolerance and recovery
- Scaling to handle high-throughput scenarios
- Integration with existing enterprise systems

**Technologies Involved:**
- Programming Languages: Scala, Python, Go
- Frameworks: Akka, Apache Kafka, Kubernetes
- Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

This context should help frame technical discussions during the meeting."""
