giHere is a comprehensive meeting briefing for the upcoming "GSoC Workflows4s" meeting:

### 1. Meeting Overview

*   **Meeting Title:** GSoC Workflows4s
*   **Date and Time:** 2025-08-25, 18:00 - 18:25 (Europe/Warsaw time)
*   **Attendees:**
    *   Wojciech Pituła (w.pitula@gmail.com)
    *   David Smith (david.smith@purplekingdomgames.com)
    *   Atharva Kanherkar (atharvakanherkar25@gmail.com)
    *   Mr. Kurro (mr.kurro@gmail.com)
*   **Meeting Location:** https://meet.google.com/cbc-jmvk-txk

### 2. Attendee Profiles

*   **Wojciech Pituła:** A key developer for `org.business4s`, actively involved in open-source projects like `forms4s-core_3` and `decisions4s-core_3`. His expertise lies in Scala (specifically Scala 3) and potentially in business process automation and decision systems. He is a crucial technical contributor.
*   **David Smith:** Director at Purple Kingdom Games Limited, serving as a Project Lead and maintainer. He possesses a strong technical background in Scala, currently building a hobby 2D game engine. His experience includes project leadership and open-source maintenance, offering insights into large-scale Scala development.
*   **Atharva Kanherkar (atharvakanherkar25@gmail.com):** Given the meeting title "GSoC Workflows4s," Atharva is likely a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) student or a key contributor working on the Workflows4s project.
*   **Mr. Kurro (mr.kurro@gmail.com):** Similar to Atharva, Mr. Kurro is likely a GSoC mentor or a significant contributor involved with the Workflows4s project.

### 3. Technical Context

The meeting is centered around "GSoC Workflows4s," indicating a Google Summer of Code project focused on a "Workflows4s" library or system. Based on Wojciech Pituła's involvement with `org.business4s` and his work on Scala 3 projects (`forms4s`, `decisions4s`), Workflows4s is almost certainly a Scala 3-based initiative. It likely pertains to business process automation, workflow management, or a similar domain, potentially within the `org.business4s` ecosystem or a related open-source context. The recurring nature of these meetings suggests ongoing development, mentorship, and progress tracking for the GSoC project.

### 4. Key Discussion Points

Based on the context, the meeting will likely cover:

*   **GSoC Workflows4s Project Status:** Updates on the current progress, completed milestones, and any challenges encountered by the GSoC student(s).
*   **Technical Implementation Details:** Discussions around specific design choices, architectural considerations, or solutions related to the Scala 3 implementation of Workflows4s.
*   **Roadmap and Next Steps:** Planning for future development, feature prioritization, and overall project direction for Workflows4s.
*   **Mentorship and Feedback:** Providing guidance, feedback, and addressing any blockers for the GSoC student(s).
*   **General Scala Development:** Given David Smith's expertise, there might be discussions on broader Scala best practices or architectural insights relevant to the project.

### 5. Preparation Recommendations

To ensure a productive meeting, it is recommended to:

*   **Review Workflows4s Project Progress:** Familiarize yourself with the latest code, documentation, and any recent updates or issues related to the Workflows4s project.
*   **Prepare Updates (for GSoC participants):** Be ready to present on your progress, any blockers encountered, and your plans for the upcoming period.
*   **Consider Technical Questions:** Prepare any specific technical challenges, design decisions, or areas requiring input from the team.
*   **Understand Project Goals:** Re-familiarize yourself with the overall objectives and scope of the GSoC Workflows4s project to align discussions.
